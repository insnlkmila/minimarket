# Minimart

Minimart was made with JavaScript, it's includes a simple Create, Read, Update , and Delete (CRUD) to introduced us as a first semester student college about programming and how to implement CRUD to the system. However, this is a basic knowledge u have to know before develop a complex web system. Minimart integrated by mySQL database.


# Simple Interface

This is how it looks, with a template:

suitable for early students who are just entering programming or individual who just start to begin learning about programming and developing an interface system web.

Good luck, hopefully useful.
